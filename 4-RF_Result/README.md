## Step 4: Compute RF distance and Plot the result

This folder contains codes for computing RF distance and plotting the result

### Instruction
1. Put ```S101\01``` dataset folder in this folder, and put generated trees in this folder.
2. Run ```CompareResult.sh``` to calculate the RF distance
3. Run ```get_RFdata.py``` to plot the data


### Instruction
- TreeCmp https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422086/

### Contents
- ```CompareResult.sh``` **Run first to generate the RF distance**
- ```get_RFdata.py``` **Run to plot the data***
- ```/TreeCmp``` TreeCmp package folder (not included)
